.
.SH NAME
.
ModuleParrot.conf \- Configuration file for the SvxLink server Parrot module
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B open-link
is a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page
describe the SvxLink server configuration for the Parrot module.
.P
The Parrot module record audio as long as the squelch is open and then plays it
back. This can be used as a simplex repeater or for tests. It also plays back
(spelling the digits) the DTMF digits it receives.
.
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.
There are a couple of configuration variables that are common to all modules.
The documentation for these can be found in the
.BR open-link.conf (5)
manual page.
.P
Here is the description of all module specific configuration
variables that the SvxLink Parrot module understands.
.
.SS ModuleParrot
.
.TP
.B FIFO_LEN
The length, in seconds, of the FIFO (First In First Out) audio buffer where
audio is recorded to. When the squelch has been opened for longer than the time
specified here, the oldest audio in the buffer will be thrown away.
.TP
.B REPEAT_DELAY
Specify a time, in milliseconds, that the parrot module will wait after squelch
close before playing back the recorded message. This is mostly a way to prevent
the parrot module to start sending if the squlech momentarily closes on weak
signals.
