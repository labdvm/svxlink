.SH NAME
.
svxreflector \- The SvxLink conference server audio reflector
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.BI "svxreflector [--help] [--daemon] [--logfile=" "log file" "] [--config=" "configuration file" "] [--pidfile=" "pid file" "] [--runasuser=" "user name" ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B svxreflector
server is used to interconnect multiple SvxLink nodes into one network. All
audio sent to the reflector from one node is retransmitted on all other
connected nodes. Only one talker is allowed at a time so if another node starts
sending audio when another one is already active, the second node will not
interrupt the first talker.
.P
A TCP/IP connection is used for the control messages and the audio is
transported via UDP. Make sure to open up the configured TCP and UDP ports in
your firewall for incoming traffic on the server. By default the port number is
set to 5300 for both TCP and UDP. The clients do not have to open any ports in
their firewall. Each node must have a unique user ID, typically the callsign.
It is not allowed for a client, using the same user ID, to connect more than
one time to the server. The connections are password protected.
.P
On the SvxLink node side, a ReflectorLogic should be used to connect to the
SvxReflector server. The connection to the SvxReflector from other logics in
that node can be activated and deactivated using standard logic linking. Read more about how to set up a SvxLink node for use with the SvxReflector in the
.BR open-link.conf (5)
manual page.
